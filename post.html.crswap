    <h1>post moves everybody must have</h1>
    <h2> <u> jump hook </u></h2>
    <p>The simple jump hook is the #1 post move every player should have in their bag of tricks.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It’s simple, effective, and can be used by any player.</p>
    <br>
    <p> The best time to use this post move is when the basketball is deep in the paint.</p>
    <br>
    <p>After you’ve caught the ball inside or backed your opponent down, simply turn sideways to the basket (right or left), bring the ball up, and then flick your wrist to put the basketball in the hoop.</p>
    <h2>Detailed ‘Jump Hook’ Example:</h2>
    <div id="list1">
        <ol>
        <li>Catch the basketball on the left block in a low, wide stance.</li>
        <li>With your back to the basket, give a quick ball and shoulder fake to the right before taking one or two dribbles towards the middle.</li>
        <li>In this situation, you should come to a two-foot jump stop with your chest facing the sideline and inside shoulder parallel with the hoop.</li>
        <li>From here, start bringing the ball up vertically along your outside shoulder with two hands for control.</li>
        <li>Once the ball is above your head level, the non-shooting hand comes off the basketball and is used to protect the shot from getting blocked.</li>
        <li>Finally, a quick snap of the wrist should see the basketball sail over the defender and drop in the hoop.</li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    <h2> <u>up and under</u></h2>
    <p>The Kevin 'Post Moves Master' McHale special.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The up and under post move is the perfect counter move after you’ve made a few hook shots.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Your defender will anticipate a small jump hook and will be ready to jump out of the gym to block your shot when they get another chance.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But they don’t see what’s coming…</p>
    <br>
    <p>Instead of going up for the jump hook, you fake the shot, step through, and finish with a wide open layup as the defender floats in the air wondering what happened.</p>
    <h2> Detailed ‘Up and Under’ Example:</h2>
    <div id="list2">
        <ol>
            <li>Catch the basketball on the left block in a low, wide stance</li>
            <li>With your back to the basket, give a quick ball and shoulder fake to the right before taking one or two dribbles towards the middle.</li>
            <li>Same as the jump hook, come to a two-foot jump stop with your chest facing the sideline and inside shoulder parallel with the hoop</li>
            <li> But instead of shooting, trick your defender by giving them a shot fake to get them in the air.</li>
            <li>Then, with your left foot as your pivot foot, step through with your right foot and finish with a wide open left hand layup at the rim.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <h2> <u> drop step </u> </h2>
    <p>The drop step can be a deadly weapon in your post move arsenal.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It’s not a complicated move, but it requires a player to quickly read the positioning of their defender and execute the drop step at exactly the right time.</p>
    <br>
    <p>for the drop step to work, you must get the defender to commit to one side, extend your foot backwards as you take a dribble, and then use your body to shield the basketball.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If executed correctly, the only way for the defender to recover and block the shot will be to go over your back leading to a foul.</p>
    <div id="list3">
        <ol>
            <li> Catch the basketball on the left block in a low, wide stance</li>
            <li>Turn towards the middle of the floor and take one or two dribbles to close the space between you and the defender.</li>
            <li>As you take the final dribble, extend your right leg back to the baseline side of the defender to establish this as your pivot foot.</li>
            <li>Swing your left leg and body towards the baseline to get by your defender.</li>
            <li>Protect the basketball with your body as quickly finish at the rim.</li>
        </ol>
