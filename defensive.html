            <h1>Defensive techniques.</h1>

            <h2>1. <u>defensive stance </u> </h2>
            <p>Good defense begins with the defensive stance, one of the most important fundamentals skills in the sport of basketball.</p>
            <p>Plant your feet a little wider than shoulder-width apart to get into a defensive stance. You want your body to be in a medium stance between standing and crouching, so your center of gravity is relatively low, making lateral movement easier, but not too high so that you can get thrown off balance easily.</p>
            <p>Your back should be straight, your knees somewhat bent, and your hands should be out at approximately shoulder height.</p>
            <p>You should be about arm’s length from your opponent. This will allow you to react quickly, have your hands ready for blocks, deflections, or steals, and keep the pressure on your opposition.</p>

            <h2>2. <u> closeout </u> </h2>
            <p>A closeout is when a defensive player sprints to an offensive player, slowing down when they are close by making small, rapid steps.</p>
            <p>It’s essential to keep your hands up and ready; the object is to crowd the offensive player, putting them off balance and limiting their ability to pass or shoot.</p>

            <h2>3.<u>box out </u> </h2>
            <p> Boxing out is a fundamental basketball skill</p>
            <p>Both offensive and defensive players use it, but it’s essential to practice this skill when playing defense.</p>
            <p>You are essentially getting into the defensive stance to box out, placing yourself between the basketball (or the basket) and the offensive player you are guarding.</p>
            <p>Use your low center of gravity to press your opponent backward, making it harder for them to get the rebound.<p>
            
            <h2>4.<u>help</u></h2>
            <p>In basketball defensive strategy, “help” is a specific term for assisting other players with their defense.</p>
            <p>A great dribbler will inevitably get past their defender some of the time, but it takes a team to prevent them from evading the defense.</p>
            <p>Being able to rotate from off-ball to on-ball defender, stop a baseline drive or a quick pass, and shift quickly to double-team defense, is what makes excellent team defense.</p>

            <h1> 8 tips for playig defensivly </h1>
            
            <h2>1.<u>stay in the defensive stance </u> </h2>
            <p>Whether playing zone defense or man-to-man defense, a skilled defender will always be in the defensive stance.</p>
            <p>If you let yourself slump, you may be allowing the offensive ball handler to shoot, pass, or make a layup.</p>
            <p>The closer you are to being physically ready to defend, the less time it will take to make a decisive defensive move.</p>
            
            <h2>2.<u>be mindfull of ur torso</u></h2>
            <p>Basketball, especially when playing offense, requires the elements of surprise and deception. Head fakes, shoulder fakes, and shot fakes are part of any skilled offensive player’s repertoire.</p>
            <p>These moves aim to mess with the footwork and throw the defender off balance, creating scoring opportunities.</p>
            <p>If you keep an eye on the opposition player’s torso, it’s unlikely they will fool you, and you will know right away what they are going to do—shoot, dribble, pass, or drive.</p>
            
            <h2>3.<u>communicate with ur teammates</u></h2>
            <p> It’s essential to let your teammates know what’s going on in the play, tell them your defensive position, call for or offer help, or pass along a strategy update from the coach.</p>
            <p>The better you communicate with your teammates, the better your defense.</p>
            
            <h2>4.<u>watch out for fouls</u></h2>
            <p>Defensive basketball requires balance</p>
            <p>On the one hand, you want to be as aggressive as you can, not giving your opponents an inch of opportunity to score, but if you go too far, you’ll wind up fouling them repeatedly, and your efforts will backfire.</p>
            
            <h2>5.<u>stay balanced</u></h2>
            <p>Be ready to move in any direction, splitting your reach between blocking the passing lane and directly pressuring the player you are defending.</p>
            <p>Keep most of your weight on the balls of your feet; this will allow for greater quickness and swift changes of direction.</p>

            <h2>6.<u>be persistent</u></h2>
            <p>Stay focused when playing against skilled offensive players who are playing an aggressive, coordinated game.</p>
            <p>If you have to keep applying ball pressure or jumping for the rebound, keep going until you’ve achieved your goal or the gameplay changes—persistence will make you a better defender.</p>

            <h2>7.<u>challenge urself</u></h2>
            <p>When practicing defensive drills, whether it’s one-on-one or a team scrimmage, try to challenge yourself.</p>
            <p>Seeking a matchup with a skilled offensive player significantly better than you will help you get faster, stronger, and more experienced as a defensive player.</p>

            <h2>8.<u>watch the opposing team</u></h2>
            <p>Defense involves learning to read the players on the opposing team.</p>
            <P>Keep an eye out for the extra aggressive players and identify players who aren’t as sure of themselves. See who is more likely to shoot or pass and who is good at rebounds.</P>
            <p>Then, share this info with your team. The better informed your team is, the better you’ll be at defense.</p>
